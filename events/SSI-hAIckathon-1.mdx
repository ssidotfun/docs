## Inspiration & What Apps to Launch

To better inspire our first batch of app creators, the main track of this hAIckathon will focus on mini-games.

**Possible Mini-Game Types:**

- **Endless Runner:** Side-scrolling or vertical-running game where players avoid obstacles and collect items for high scores.
- **Clicker/Idle Game:** Tap or click to earn resources, unlock upgrades, and progress even when idle.
- **Match-3 Puzzle:** Swap adjacent tiles to align three or more matching symbols, clear them, and trigger chain reactions.
- **Memory-Match Cards:** Flip pairs of cards to find matching icons; increase grid size or include a timer.
- **Reaction Time Tester:** Display random prompts (color or shape change); players click as quickly as possible to test reflexes.
- **Trivia Quiz:** Sequence of multiple-choice questions on any topic; track correct/incorrect answers for a final score.
- **Snake Clone:** Control a growing “snake” that eats items, avoids walls and its own tail, aiming to last as long as possible.
- **Flappy-Style Jumper:** Tap or click to keep a character airborne, navigating through gaps between obstacles.
- **Slider Puzzle:** Shuffle numbered or image tiles in a grid; slide them back into the correct order to solve the puzzle.
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors Variant:** Classic RPS or expanded versions (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock) with simple animations and score tracking.
- **Spot the Difference:** Display two similar images side by side with subtle differences; players click mismatches before time runs out.
- **Word-Guessing (Hangman):** Show blank spaces for letters; players guess letters one at a time to reveal the hidden word before too many mistakes.
- **Dodge & Collect:** Top-down or side view where a character avoids falling objects or enemies while collecting power-ups for points.
- **2048-Style Tile Merge:** Combine numbered tiles by swiping or clicking to reach higher values, aiming for a target tile (e.g., 2048).
- **Whack-a-Mole:** Pop-up icons (moles or themed characters) appear briefly; players click quickly to score before they disappear.
- **Maze Navigator:** Generate a small maze; the player moves a character (arrow keys or clicks) to reach the exit in minimal time.
- **Color-Matching Tap:** Circles or shapes of varying colors appear and move; players tap matching-color targets under time pressure.
- **Minimal Platformer:** Simple single-screen levels where a character jumps between platforms to collect items and reach a goal.
- **Virtual Pet Lite:** Interact with a small on-screen pet—feed, play mini-challenges, and watch animations in real time.
- **Rhythm Tap:** Play a short track and prompt users to tap in sync with beats or visual cues, tracking accuracy and combos.
